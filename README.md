### :moneybag: Using HTML, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery and a local storage, I (along with Web Developer's Course) created a system to register and store expenses, with date, type, description and cost information of each expense.

The system is coded to not allow invalid dates and cost values (such as characters on these fields), and also won't allow any empty field :lock::lock:. You can register as much expenses as you want, and it will be stored on your internal browser storage. 

You can filter queries by any of the register information (day, month, year, type, description and cost), and you can delete the expense you want, with a safety alert to confirm that you really want to delete it :package:.
